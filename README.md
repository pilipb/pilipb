I'm a graduate of an engineering design masters from the University of Bristol

Working on [openskips.com](https://openskips.com)

And an alcohol tracker [beerometer? tbd](https://drink-tracking.web.app/#/login)

Take a look at [my website](https://pilipb.github.io).

The repositories in my profile focus on modelling, image and data analysis, and general experimentation!
